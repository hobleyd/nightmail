# NightMail — Claude Code Guide

## Architecture

Clean Architecture, 4 layers. Never bypass layers.

```
core/       — Failure, UseCase, Exception types
domain/     — Entities, Repository interfaces, Use cases
data/       — Models, Datasources, Repository impls
presentation/ — BLoCs/Cubits, Pages, Widgets
```

- DI via `get_it` (`sl<T>()` in `injection_container.dart`)
- Error handling: `fpdart` `Either<Failure, T>` (not `dartz`)
- State: `flutter_bloc`
- Bundle IDs: always `au.com.sharpblue` prefix (never `com.sharpblue`)

## Building

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build macos --debug
flutter run
```

Always `flutter clean` after changing entitlements or code signing settings.

## macOS Native Channels

Custom platform channels live in `macos/Runner/MainFlutterWindow.swift`.

**Critical rule: store every `FlutterMethodChannel` as an instance property.**
`FlutterMethodChannel` unregisters its handler in `dealloc`. A local variable is
released when the function returns → `MissingPluginException` on every call.

```swift
// WRONG — channel is released when awakeFromNib() returns
let ch = FlutterMethodChannel(name: "...", binaryMessenger: messenger)
ch.setMethodCallHandler { ... }

// CORRECT — stored property keeps the channel alive
private var myChannel: FlutterMethodChannel?
myChannel = FlutterMethodChannel(name: "...", binaryMessenger: messenger)
myChannel?.setMethodCallHandler { ... }
```

**`desktop_multi_window` creates a separate `FlutterEngine` per window.**
Register every channel on the main window AND inside `setOnWindowCreatedCallback`
so secondary windows (e.g. the compose window) can reach the handler:

```swift
registerMyChannel(messenger: flutterViewController.engine.binaryMessenger)

FlutterMultiWindowPlugin.setOnWindowCreatedCallback { [weak self] controller in
    RegisterGeneratedPlugins(registry: controller)
    self?.registerMyChannel(messenger: controller.engine.binaryMessenger)
}
```

Use an array to retain all channel instances:
```swift
private var allChannels: [FlutterMethodChannel] = []
```

## macOS Privacy Permissions (TCC)

### Contacts

The contacts channel is implemented natively in `MainFlutterWindow.swift`
(`au.com.sharpblue.nightmail/contacts`). Do **not** use the `flutter_contacts`
package — its SPM artifacts do not link into the app bundle reliably.

**Do not add `com.apple.security.personal-information.addressbook` to
`DebugProfile.entitlements`.** This entitlement is for sandboxed apps only.
On a non-sandboxed debug build it causes `CNError.authorizationDenied` (code 100)
without ever showing a dialog.

The entitlement belongs only in `Release.entitlements` (which enables the sandbox).

### TCC permission dialogs require real code signing

For macOS TCC to show a permission dialog the binary must have a real **Team ID**.
Ad-hoc signing (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = "-"`) produces `TeamIdentifier=not set`
and TCC auto-denies all requests silently.

Checklist to get a working Team ID in debug builds:
1. Install the **Apple WWDR G3** intermediate certificate (the G1 expired 2023):
   ```bash
   curl -O https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/AppleWWDRCAG3.cer
   open AppleWWDRCAG3.cer
   ```
2. Create an Apple Development certificate in **Xcode → Settings → Accounts →
   Manage Certificates → + → Apple Development**.
3. Verify: `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` should show 1 valid identity.
4. Remove `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = "-"` from the **project-level** Debug
   `XCBuildConfiguration` in `Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (xcconfig
   overrides don't work — project-level settings win over xcconfig).
5. Verify after build: `codesign -d --verbose=4 NightMail.app | grep TeamIdentifier`
   should show your team ID, not "not set".

### Testing TCC permissions

**Launch via Finder or `open`, not `flutter run`.**

`flutter run` uses an intermediate launcher process that can confuse macOS 15's TCC
into returning `authorizationDenied` even when the app is correctly signed and the
status is `notDetermined`. Running the `.app` directly bypasses this:

```bash
open build/macos/Build/Products/Debug/NightMail.app
```

If the permission dialog has been denied and won't appear again:
```bash
sudo tccutil reset Contacts          # reset all apps (no bundle ID needed)
# or
sudo tccutil reset Contacts au.com.sharpblue.nightmail
```

Use `sudo` — system-level TCC entries require it. Without `sudo`, `tccutil reset`
may silently fail.

### Use the completion-handler form of `requestAccess`

On macOS 15 the `async/await` form of `CNContactStore.requestAccess(for:)` throws
`CNError.authorizationDenied` for `notDetermined` apps. The completion-handler form
works correctly:

```swift
store.requestAccess(for: .contacts) { granted, error in
    DispatchQueue.main.async { result(granted ? "granted" : "denied") }
}
```

## AI Subsystem

The AI slice (compose reply, provider catalog, inference) introduces two
deliberate deviations from the repo's default Clean-Architecture conventions.
They are intentional — do not "fix" them back to the default shape.

### Streaming repositories return `Stream<Either<Failure, AiChunk>>`

`AiInferenceRepository.stream(...)` returns `Stream<Either<Failure, AiChunk>>`
(`lib/domain/repositories/ai_inference_repository.dart`) rather than the usual
`Future<Either<Failure, T>>`. This is a deliberate new repo shape for streaming:
each emitted item is an `Either`, so a mid-stream failure surfaces as a `Left`
on the stream instead of throwing. Single-shot AI repo methods keep the normal
`Future<Either<Failure, T>>` form. Future streaming repos should follow this
same `Stream<Either<Failure, T>>` shape.

### AI wire adapters return `Either<Failure, T>` directly

Unlike the catalog datasources (which throw `ServerException`/`NetworkException`
for the repository to convert), the inference wire adapters
(`lib/data/datasources/ai/inference/ai_adapter.dart` and impls) return
`Either<Failure, T>` directly rather than throwing. This is intentional:
streaming forces it — you cannot "throw then convert in the repo" across an
async stream, so the adapter must emit `Left(failure)` inline. For consistency
the single-shot adapter path returns `Either` the same way rather than mixing
throw-and-convert with emit-`Left` in one class.

## Contacts Typeahead Architecture

- `lib/domain/repositories/system_contacts_repository.dart` — abstract interface
- `lib/data/repositories/system_contacts_repository_impl.dart` — calls native channel
- `lib/domain/usecases/search_contacts.dart` — combines known senders + system contacts
- `lib/domain/entities/contact_suggestion.dart` — `{address, name, displayText}`
- `_RecipientField` in `compose_dialog.dart` calls `warmUp()` eagerly in `initState()`
  so the permission dialog appears when the compose window opens, not on first keystroke.
